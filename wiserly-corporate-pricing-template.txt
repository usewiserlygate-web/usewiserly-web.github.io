EXPANSION ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

Use this framework when discussing expansion opportunities with hospital CFOs
and revenue cycle leaders. These questions identify how much WISeRly can save.

CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (Discovery Questions):
1. How many prior authorizations does your organization process monthly?
2. What is your current denial rate? (typical: 35-40%)
3. How many staff dedicate time to PA submission and appeals?
4. What is your average cost per denied claim (including resubmission)?
5. How many days does average denial→approval take?
6. What specialties have highest denial rates? (orthopedic, cardiology, etc.)
7. Which insurers cause most denials? (UnitedHealthcare, Anthem, Medicaid?)
8. Do you track "avoidable denials" vs clinical denials?

SAVINGS CALCULATION TEMPLATE:

Monthly PAs: _______ x Current Denial Rate: ___% = Monthly Denials: _______

Monthly Denials: _______ x $2,500 avg cost per denial = Monthly Loss: $_______

WISeRly Target: 70% reduction of preventable denials

Estimated Monthly Denials Prevented: _______ x 0.70 = _______

Monthly Revenue Impact: _______ denials prevented x $2,500 = $ _____ /month

Annual ROI: $ _______ x 12 = $ _________ /year

Platform Cost: (monthly tier) x 12 = $_________ /year

NET FIRST YEAR SAVINGS: $ _________ - Platform Cost = $ _________

---

EXPANSION OPPORTUNITY IDENTIFICATION:

If hospital shows these patterns, propose expansion:
✓ Multi-specialty sites (recommend Enterprise)
✓ High denial rates in specific conditions (add Intelligence Packs)
✓ Multiple EHR systems (recommend Enterprise for integration)
✓ Geographic spread (multi-facility discount potential)
✓ Complex payer mix (add payer-specific modules)

Expansion Questions:
"Are you interested in expanding to [other departments/locations]?"
"Would you like to optimize denials for [high-denial specialty]?"
"Should we integrate [second EHR system] in Q2?"

SALES SCRIPT TEMPLATE
================================================================================

OBJECTION 1: "How quickly will we see ROI?"

"Most organizations see ROI within 24-48 hours. Here's why:
- Your first prevented denial pays for the entire month.
- With 35-40% denial rate, a 100-bed hospital processes ~500+ denials/month.
- Each prevented denial saves $2,500+.
- At 70% denial prevention, you're looking at $875K+ in recovered revenue monthly.
- Platform cost is $999-3,000/month.
- Payback: First week."

OBJECTION 2: "We're concerned about implementation complexity."

"You go live within hours. Here's the timeline:
- Hour 0: Sign up and activate trial
- Hour 1-2: Team completes our certification training (online, self-paced)
- Hour 3-4: Staff submits first test cases
- Hour 4+: Processing real claims

We handle all technical setup. You just train your team."

OBJECTION 3: "Will this work with our EHR?"

"Yes. We integrate with Epic, Cerner, Athena, and most major systems. We also
accept secure uploads, API connections, or direct submissions.

If you use a less common EHR, we can build a custom integration during your
Enterprise implementation—included in your pricing."

OBJECTION 4: "What if we don't see the 70% improvement?"

"We track this in real time. Your dashboard shows:
- Denials prevented per month
- Revenue recovered
- Specific insurers and conditions with highest improvement

If you're not seeing results, we investigate and optimize. Most issues are
documentation-related, and we provide remediation training."

OBJECTION 5: "How much does this actually cost with everything?"

"Here's a real example for a 300-bed hospital:
- Platform (Enterprise): $3,000/month = $36,000/year
- Training (25 people): $5,000 (one-time)
- First year: $41,000
- First month savings: $1.5M - $2.5M+
- Year 1 net: $18M - $29M+ savings

ROI: 295:1 (you save $295 for every $1 spent)"

================================================================================
EXPANSION METRICS TO TRACK
================================================================================

For each customer, track these metrics to identify expansion opportunities:

1. Utilization Rate
   └─ Current submissions vs capacity
   └─ If >80% capacity, propose upgrade

2. Denial Prevention Rate
   └─ Monthly denials prevented
   └─ Revenue impact
   └─ If >70%, propose expansion modules

3. Specialty Penetration
   └─ Which departments using platform?
   └─ Uncovered specialties = upsell opportunities

4. Geographic Spread
   └─ Which facilities using it?
   └─ New facilities = multi-site upgrade opportunity

5. Team Expansion
   └─ How many staff trained vs employed?
   └─ If capacity limited, propose training add-on

---

EXPANSION CONVERSATION TRIGGERS:

✓ "I noticed you're at 85% submission capacity. Should we upgrade to more?"
✓ "Your orthopedic denials dropped 75%. Should we apply this to cardiology too?"
✓ "You have 8 facilities. Are the others interested in this capability?"
✓ "We see 40 staff trained. Would you like all 100 staff trained for unlimited?"
