Note: GoDaddy Website Builder may not support direct HTML upload.
If you're using the drag-and-drop builder, you'll need to:

1. Create a new blank page
2. Add a "Custom HTML" widget or "Embed Code" section
3. Copy the content from each .html file
4. Paste into the custom HTML sections
5. Add the images separately

This is MORE COMPLICATED. See Option B below for easier method.

OPTION B: If Using GoDaddy cPanel/File Manager (RECOMMENDED):
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is the BEST way to upload your professional HTML files.

1. From your GoDaddy account, go to "Web Hosting" section
2. Click "Manage" next to your hosting plan
3. Scroll down to find "cPanel" or "File Manager"
4. Click "File Manager" or "cPanel"

================================================================================
STEP 4: UPLOAD FILES VIA CPANEL FILE MANAGER (RECOMMENDED METHOD)
================================================================================

PART A: Navigate to Your Website Directory

2. Double-click "public_html" to open it
3. This is where your website files will live

--------------------------
1. Click "Upload" button (usually top of screen)
2. A new window/page will open
3. Click "Select File" or drag files into the upload area
4. Upload these files IN THIS ORDER:
   - index.html
   - training.html
   - contact.html
   - styles.css

5. Wait for each file to finish uploading (you'll see 100% complete)
6. Click "Go Back" or close the upload window

PART C: Upload Image Files
---------------------------
1. Still in the public_html folder
2. Click "Upload" again

================================================================================

This step ensures visitors see your homepage when they visit your domain.

1. In File Manager, find "index.html"
2. Right-click on "index.html"
3. Select "Set as Index" or "Default Page"
   (Or it may already be set if it's named index.html)

================================================================================
STEP 6: TEST YOUR WEBSITE
================================================================================

================================================================================
STEP 8: MAKE FORMS WORK (IMPORTANT!)
================================================================================

Right now, the forms will display but won't actually SEND emails.
You need to connect them to a form processor.

OPTION A: Use Formspree (FREE - RECOMMENDED):
---------------------------------------------
1. Go to www.formspree.io
2. Sign up for free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy the form endpoint URL they give you
5. In File Manager, edit index.html, training.html, and contact.html
6. Find: <form>
7. Change to: <form action="YOUR_FORMSPREE_URL" method="POST">
8. Save file
9. Test form - emails will now come to info@usewiserly.com

OPTION B: Use GoDaddy Email Hosting:
------------------------------------
1. Contact GoDaddy support
2. Ask them to help connect forms to your email
3. They may charge a small fee for this service

================================================================================
STEP 9: CONNECT YOUR DOMAIN (IF NOT ALREADY CONNECTED)
================================================================================

If your website doesn't show up at your domain:

1. In GoDaddy, go to "Domains"
2. Find your domain (usewiserly.com)
3. Click "DNS" or "Manage DNS"
4. Look for "A Record" settings
5. Make sure A Record points to your hosting server IP
   (GoDaddy support can help with this if needed)

Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to propagate (this is normal)

================================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: Files uploaded but website doesn't show
SOLUTION: Make sure files are in "public_html" folder, not a subfolder

PROBLEM: Images don't display
SOLUTION: Check that image filenames match EXACTLY (case-sensitive):
         - square_profile_i.png (lowercase)
         - wide_bannetter_F.png (capital F)

PROBLEM: Styling looks wrong
SOLUTION: Make sure styles.css uploaded correctly
         Make sure it's in same folder as HTML files

PROBLEM: Website shows old content
SOLUTION: Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+R)
         Try viewing in "Incognito/Private" mode

PROBLEM: GoDaddy won't let me upload files
SOLUTION: You may need to upgrade to a hosting plan that allows HTML uploads
         Contact GoDaddy support: 1-480-505-8877

================================================================================
NEED HELP?
================================================================================

IF YOU GET STUCK:

1. GoDaddy Support (24/7):
   - Phone: 1-480-505-8877
   - Chat: Available on GoDaddy website
   - Say: "I need help uploading custom HTML files to my website"

2. Email me your question:
   - Take a screenshot of where you're stuck
   - Email to: [your email]
   - I'll help you troubleshoot

3. YouTube Tutorial:
   - Search: "How to upload HTML to GoDaddy cPanel"
   - Watch 2-3 videos to see the process visually

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: USE A SUBDOMAIN FOR TESTING
================================================================================

If you want to test before going live on your main domain:

1. Ask GoDaddy to create a subdomain: test.usewiserly.com
2. Upload all files to that subdomain
3. Test everything thoroughly
4. Once perfect, move files to main domain

================================================================================
YOU'RE READY TO LAUNCH! 🚀
