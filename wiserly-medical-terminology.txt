Feature-by-Feature Breakdown for Physicians & Clinical Leaders
January 22, 2026

================================================================================
FEATURE 1: 70+ MEDICARE CONDITIONS ANALYSIS
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
WISeRly analyzes prior authorization requirements for 70+ Medicare high-denial
conditions (those with 50-78% denial rates). These are conditions with complex
documentation requirements where denials are common.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR PHYSICIANS:

The platform covers high-denial conditions including:

ORTHOPEDIC/SPINE:
├─ Cervical/Lumbar Discectomy (70% denial rate without documentation)
├─ Spinal Fusion with instrumentation (68% denial rate)
├─ Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty (65% denial rate)
└─ Requires: Failed conservative treatment documentation, imaging showing
   specific pathology, degenerative disc disease severity, pain scale scores

CARDIOLOGY:
├─ Complex PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) (72% denial rate)
├─ Cardiac defibrillator implantation (61% denial rate)
├─ Cardiac catheterization with intervention (58% denial rate)
└─ Requires: EF measurement, arrhythmia documentation, failed medical
   management evidence, cardiology consult

NEUROLOGY:
├─ Carotid artery stenting (75% denial rate)
├─ Intracranial stent placement (78% denial rate)
├─ Deep brain stimulation (71% denial rate)
└─ Requires: Specific neurologic deficit documentation, imaging correlation,
   failed first-line treatment evidence

ONCOLOGY:
├─ Prostate cancer radiation (bimodality) (64% denial rate)
├─ Inpatient chemotherapy for complex malignancies (60% denial rate)
├─ Targeted therapy with genomic markers (68% denial rate)
└─ Requires: Cancer stage, metastatic workup, genomic testing results,
   pathology confirmation

PULMONARY:
├─ Lung transplant listing (73% denial rate)
├─ Mechanical ventilation >14 days (70% denial rate)
├─ ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) (79% denial rate)
└─ Requires: Specific ventilator parameters, blood gas trends, SOFA scores,
   multidisciplinary team documentation

---

HOW WISeRly HELPS:

When you submit a prior authorization for cervical discectomy, WISeRly checks:

1. REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION ELEMENTS:
   ├─ Imaging correlation (MRI findings matching clinical symptoms)
   ├─ Conservative treatment failure (documentation of PT, NSAIDs, injections)
   ├─ Surgical indication specificity (nerve root compression with radiculopathy)
   ├─ Comorbidity management (diabetes control, cardiac clearance if needed)
   └─ Timing justification (why now vs wait-and-see)

2. SPECIFIC PHRASING REQUIREMENTS:
   ├─ Medicare requires "radiculopathy" not just "nerve pain"
   ├─ Must document "motor deficit" if claiming disability
   ├─ Imaging must show "compressive pathology" not just "degenerative changes"
   └─ Must specify which nerve roots affected (C5, C6, C7)

3. STATE-SPECIFIC VARIATIONS:
   ├─ Some states require additional physical therapy documentation
   ├─ Workers compensation cases require specific workers comp language
   ├─ Medicaid requirements differ by state (NY requires different docs than CA)
   └─ VA cases require nexus documentation to service-connected condition

4. INSURER-SPECIFIC THRESHOLDS:
   ├─ UnitedHealthcare requires ≥3 months conservative treatment
   ├─ Anthem requires formal PT completion, not just recommendation
   ├─ CIGNA requires pre-op imaging <3 months old
   └─ Aetna requires cardiology clearance if age >65

---

PHYSICIAN BENEFIT:

Instead of learning these requirements individually for 70+ conditions, you get
instant validation. WISeRly says: "Your documentation meets X requirement but
needs Y and Z." You fix it in 2 minutes, submit with confidence, and get approved
on first submission.

================================================================================
FEATURE 2: 300 PRIVATE INSURER POLICIES
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Real-time mappings of prior authorization policies across 300+ condition-insurer
combinations. Includes UnitedHealthcare (30 policies), Anthem (28 policies),
Aetna (25 policies), CIGNA (22 policies), Humana (20 policies), regional plans,
and state Medicaid programs.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR PHYSICIANS:

Each insurer has different medical necessity thresholds:

ORTHOPEDIC EXAMPLE - Lumbar Fusion:

UnitedHealthcare Policy:
├─ Requires: ≥1 year conservative treatment
├─ Must document: Narcotics >3 months, failed epidural injection
├─ Imaging: MRI showing ≥50% stenosis at fusion level
├─ Contraindication: Active infection excludes approval
└─ Approval time: 3-5 business days if compliant

Anthem Policy:
├─ Requires: ≥6 months conservative treatment (different!)
├─ Must document: Physical therapy completion, pain medication trials
├─ Imaging: CT acceptable if MRI contraindicated
├─ Contraindication: Coagulopathy requires hematology clearance
└─ Approval time: 2-3 business days

CIGNA Policy:
├─ Requires: ≥3 months conservative treatment (most lenient)
├─ Must document: Any combination of PT/medications/injections
├─ Imaging: Can be older (≤6 months) if clinical correlation strong
├─ Contraindication: Severe cardiopulmonary disease requires clearance
└─ Approval time: 2 business days

---

CARDIOLOGIST EXAMPLE - Defibrillator Implant:

UnitedHealthcare:
├─ Requires: EF ≤35% on optimal medical therapy
├─ Must verify: ACE inhibitor + beta blocker ≥3 months trial
├─ Monitoring: 2+ failed device interrogation attempts
└─ Prior PA: Previous ICD required as step-wise approach

Anthem:
├─ Requires: EF ≤40% (more liberal!)
├─ Must verify: Any two cardiac meds for ≥1 month
├─ Monitoring: Documented syncope episodes or arrhythmias
└─ Prior PA: CRT trial 6+ months if EF 31-40%

CIGNA:
├─ Requires: EF ≤35% with NYHA Class III/IV symptoms
├─ Must verify: Medication trial ≥3 months
├─ Monitoring: Holter or event monitor showing high-burden arrhythmia
└─ Prior PA: ICD therapy documented as indicated

---

HOW WISeRly HELPS:

When you're treating a patient with EF 35% and want to place an ICD:

WISeRly analyzes the patient's insurance and tells you:
✓ UnitedHealthcare: APPROVED (meets EF ≤35% threshold)
✓ Anthem: APPROVED (meets EF ≤40% threshold)
✓ CIGNA: REQUIRES documentation of NYHA Class III/IV symptoms

Then it tells you exactly what's missing:
"Your note says 'shortness of breath' but CIGNA requires 'NYHA Class III or IV
dyspnea on exertion.' Add this language: 'Patient experiences [specific symptom]
limiting activities to [specific functional level].'"

You add 20 words, resubmit, and get approved instead of denied.

---

PHYSICIANS ASK: "Why does documentation matter this much?"

ANSWER: Insurance companies aren't making clinical decisions. They're checking
compliance with their published policies. If their policy says "requires NYHA
Class III," and you wrote "shortness of breath," their system rejects it
automatically. It's not clinical judgment—it's policy compliance.

WISeRly bridges this gap by translating your clinical documentation into
insurer policy language automatically.

================================================================================
FEATURE 3: SELF-HEALING CLINICAL NOTES
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
AI-generated exact phrasing recommendations to make your clinical documentation
comply with insurer policies. Not replacement notes—suggested phrases you can
copy-paste into your existing documentation.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR PHYSICIANS:

EXAMPLE 1: PAIN SCALE DOCUMENTATION

What you wrote:
"Patient reports moderate pain in lower back radiating to left leg."

What WISeRly suggests for UnitedHealthcare approval:
"Patient reports pain [0-10 scale: 7/10] in lumbar region radiating to left leg
below knee, consistent with left L5 radiculopathy. Pain worsens with forward
bending and activity, limits function to [specific activity]."

Why the difference?
├─ Insurance needs numerical pain scale (0-10) not "moderate"
├─ They need anatomical specificity (below vs above knee = L5 vs L4 nerve)
├─ They need functional impact (what activities are limited)
├─ They track trends (pain trajectory matters for surgery approval)

---

EXAMPLE 2: FAILURE OF CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT

What you wrote:
"Patient tried physical therapy and medications without improvement."

What WISeRly suggests:
"Patient completed 12 weeks of supervised physical therapy [dates] including
manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and modality-based treatment without
functional improvement. Visual analog scale: [date] 8/10, [current] 7/10
indicating persistent pain despite intervention. Trialed ibuprofen 600mg TID,
naproxen 500mg BID, and acetaminophen 1000mg QID without adequate pain control.
Failed epidural corticosteroid injection [date] with only 3 days temporary relief."

Why the difference?
├─ Insurance wants specifics (PT duration, types, outcomes)
├─ They need quantified outcomes (VAS scores, dates)
├─ They want medication dosing and duration (not just "tried meds")
├─ They want injection outcomes (did it work? How long?)

---

EXAMPLE 3: IMAGING CORRELATION

What you wrote:
"MRI shows disc herniation at L4-L5."

What WISeRly suggests for CIGNA approval:
"MRI imaging [date] demonstrates central and left-lateral disc herniation at
L4-L5 level with left L5 nerve root compression and mild left-sided stenosis.
Imaging findings correlate with patient's reported left radicular pain in L5
distribution (lateral calf) and reproducible positive straight leg raise test at
45 degrees indicating nerve root tension."

Why the difference?
├─ Insurance needs imaging specificity (central vs lateral = different pathology)
├─ They want clinical correlation (how does imaging match symptoms?)
├─ They want testing confirmation (SLR positive = supports imaging finding)
├─ This prevents "incidental finding" denials

---

EXAMPLE 4: CONTRAINDICATION MANAGEMENT

What you wrote:
"Patient has diabetes."

What WISeRly suggests for UnitedHealthcare spine surgery approval:
"Patient has Type 2 diabetes mellitus (ICD-10: E11.9) managed with metformin
1000mg BID. Most recent HbA1c [date]: 6.8% (target <7% for surgery). Patient
has no diabetic neuropathy [document: nerve conduction study normal/recent exam
normal]. Renal function adequate for contrast studies [creatinine 0.9]."

Why the difference?
├─ Surgery requires controlled diabetes not just "has diabetes"
├─ They need recent labs (HbA1c dates matter)
├─ They want to know about diabetic complications (neuropathy affects surgery)
├─ Renal function matters for imaging contrast if needed

---

HOW IT WORKS IN PRACTICE:

You see WISeRly's suggestion and can:
✓ Accept it and copy-paste
✓ Modify it to match your clinical style
✓ Reject it and keep your original
✓ Ask WISeRly to explain why it's suggesting this

You stay in control. Your clinical documentation improves. Approvals increase.

================================================================================
FEATURE 4: PEDIATRIC EPSDT COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) is federal
Medicaid mandate requiring coverage of any medically necessary services for
children <21. WISeRly checks compliance with EPSDT requirements and state
variations.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR PEDIATRICIANS:

EPSDT REQUIREMENTS:

Screening Services (routine preventive):
├─ Vision screening
├─ Hearing screening
├─ Developmental screening (via validated instruments)
├─ Immunization counseling
└─ Nutrition assessment

Diagnostic Services (evaluating findings):
├─ Eye exam if vision screening abnormal
├─ Audiology if hearing screening abnormal
├─ Developmental evaluation if screening abnormal
└─ Must follow-up on ALL screen-positive findings

Treatment Services (treating identified problems):
├─ Any medically necessary treatment
├─ No age limits on coverage
├─ No deductibles or copays
└─ Parents cannot refuse EPSDT evaluations

---

PEDIATRIC PRIOR AUTH EXAMPLE: Developmental Disorder Evaluation

Child: 3-year-old with speech delay identified on screening

What you need for Medicaid approval:
├─ Denver Developmental Screening Test (DDST) results (positive finding)
├─ Rationale for speech evaluation (not just "I think they need it")
├─ Specific functional deficits (words understood, words spoken, intelligibility)
├─ Who's evaluating (speech-language pathologist qualifications)
└─ How evaluation informs treatment plan

WISeRly checks:
✓ Was validated screening tool used? (DDST, BAYLEY, etc.)
✓ Does state require physician referral? (varies by state)
✓ Is qualified SLP within state's scope of practice?
✓ Does documentation show medical necessity link?
✓ Does state have specific EPSDT evaluation requirements?

---

PEDIATRIC PRIOR AUTH EXAMPLE: Orthotic Device for Cerebral Palsy

Child: 5-year-old with cerebral palsy needing foot orthotics

What you need:
├─ Diagnosis (CP with specific involvement pattern: right hemiplegia)
├─ Functional limitation (gait disturbance affecting mobility)
├─ Failed conservative treatment? (usually NOT required for EPSDT)
├─ Specific device prescription (custom AFO, not just "orthotic")
├─ Timeline (is child growing? Affects replacement schedule)
└─ Provider qualifications (orthotist credentials/licensing)

WISeRly checks state variations:
├─ California: Allows prescription pad; simple authorization
├─ Texas: Requires DME supplier pre-certification
├─ New York: Requires detailed functional assessment
├─ Florida: Requires prior physical therapy documentation

---

HOW WISeRly HELPS:

Before submission, WISeRly tells you:
"For [child's age/condition], [state] Medicaid requires: [specific documentation].
You have: ✓ [what you included]. Missing: ✗ [what's needed]."

Example: "For 4-year-old speech evaluation, Illinois EPSDT requires evidence of
speech-language pathology referral from physician. You have ✓ Denver screener
positive. Missing ✗ Physician referral documentation."

You add the missing referral note, resubmit, approved.

================================================================================
FEATURE 5: VA NEXUS-AUDIT ENGINE
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Specialized compliance checking for VA Community Care prior authorizations.
Analyzes 38 CFR § 3.304(b) nexus requirements and VA CCN authorization criteria.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR VA PROVIDERS:

VA NEXUS STANDARD (38 CFR § 3.304(b)):

Medical opinion must:
├─ Relate current medical condition to military service
├─ Identify causal relationship (did military service cause this?)
├─ Consider evidence-in-chief (clinical notes, labs, imaging)
└─ Use reasonable medical probability (not just possibility)

Example for low back pain claimed as service-connected:

STRONG NEXUS STATEMENT (will likely approve):
"Veteran served as [position] 1995-1999. Current imaging shows L4-L5 disc
herniation with nerve root compression. During service, Veteran reported
experiencing acute low back injury with subsequent back pain. Military treatment
records document [date]: back strain diagnosis. Clinical correlation: Veteran's
current imaging findings consistent with injury pattern documented during
service. Nexus: With reasonable medical probability, current low back pathology
stems from service-connected back injury sustained [date]."

WEAK NEXUS STATEMENT (high denial risk):
"Veteran has low back pain and imaging abnormality consistent with
degenerative changes."

Why the difference?
├─ Strong: Links current condition to specific service event
├─ Strong: Cites military medical records as supporting evidence
├─ Strong: Uses correct legal language "reasonable medical probability"
├─ Weak: Doesn't establish service connection
├─ Weak: Doesn't reference military records
├─ Weak: Sounds like generic back pain, not service-related

---

VA RATING SCHEDULE ALIGNMENT:

For VA disability claims, medical opinion must align with Rating Schedule:

Example: Knee osteoarthritis rated under 38 CFR 4.71a, Schedule (Musculoskeletal)

Rating 20%: Disability with "mild" functional impairment
├─ Medical opinion should document: "Mild limitation"
├─ Don't write: "Severe limitation" (contradicts 20% rating)

Rating 40%: Disability with "moderate" functional impairment
├─ Medical opinion should document: "Moderate limitation with specific ADL impact"
├─ Clinical signs: Effusion, crepitus, gait abnormality documented

Rating 60%: Disability with "severe" functional impairment
├─ Medical opinion should document: "Severe limitation"
├─ Functional status: Unable to ambulate 1+ hours or activities limited

---

HOW WISeRly HELPS:

For VA Community Care authorization, WISeRly checks:
✓ Nexus statement present (required for new service-connected conditions)
✓ Nexus language uses "reasonable medical probability" or equivalent
✓ Links current condition to service event (with dates/specifics)
✓ References VA medical records or military service document
✓ Rating level justification (if applicable)
✓ CCN authorization requirements met (specific to VA network)

If missing: "Your nexus statement lacks connection to [specific service event].
Add: 'Veteran's current [condition] directly resulted from service-connected
[original condition] with reasonable medical probability.'"

================================================================================
FEATURE 6: 7-YEAR IMMUTABLE AUDIT TRAIL
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
HIPAA-compliant documentation of every action taken on patient data. Immutable
means unchangeable—prevents tampering. Regulatory requirement, not optional.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR COMPLIANCE OFFICERS:

HIPAA SECURITY RULE REQUIREMENTS (45 CFR §164.312(b)):

Audit controls must track:
├─ WHO accessed the record (user identification)
├─ WHEN it was accessed (exact timestamp)
├─ WHAT they did (read, modify, download, print, export)
├─ WHERE from (IP address, device identifier)
├─ SUCCESS/FAILURE (was action completed?)
└─ REASON (optional field for context)

Example audit log entry:
"2026-01-22 10:45:32 | User: rdavis@clinic.org | Action: Read PHI | Record:
Patient John Doe MRN 123456789 | IP: 192.168.1.150 | Result: Success | Duration:
5 mins | Data: Medical necessity documentation for L4-L5 discectomy PA"

---

WHY IMMUTABLE MATTERS:

Immutable = Cannot be edited or deleted (even by administrators)

This prevents:
❌ Admin hiding unauthorized access
❌ Malicious staff deleting their access logs
❌ Accidental deletion of compliance records
❌ Manipulation of timeline (showing action happened earlier/later than it did)

WISeRly requirement: All audit logs written to immutable database where even
server administrators cannot modify past entries.

---

HOW IT HELPS YOU:

If a HIPAA investigation occurs:
✓ Investigators see exact history of who accessed what
✓ Proves compliance with access controls
✓ Shows you maintain HIPAA audit controls
✓ Demonstrates breach notification readiness
✓ Helps identify if breach occurred (who accessed what when)

---

7-YEAR REQUIREMENT:

Why 7 years?
├─ CMS Conditions of Participation require ≥6 years retention
├─ HIPAA allows enforcement up to 6 years after violation
├─ Best practice adds 1 year buffer
└─ VA requirements may extend to 10+ years

WISeRly maintains 7-year immutable audit trail automatically.

================================================================================
FEATURE 7: HIPAA-NATIVE SECURITY
================================================================================

WHAT IT IS:
Security architecture designed specifically for healthcare protected health
information. Includes encryption, secure transmission, automatic security
updates, and compliance monitoring.

MEDICAL DETAILS FOR IT/SECURITY TEAMS:

ENCRYPTION AT REST (Data Stored):

Standard: AES-256 encryption
├─ Algorithm: Advanced Encryption Standard, 256-bit key
├─ What it protects: All patient data in database
├─ If server stolen: Data unreadable without encryption key
├─ Key management: Encrypted keys stored separately
└─ FIPS 140-2 compliant: Federal standard for cryptographic modules

Example: Patient John Doe PHI stored in database
├─ Stored value: [Encrypted binary string impossible to read]
├─ Encryption key: Stored separately in hardware security module (HSM)
├─ Access: Only application can decrypt with HSM key
└─ Protection: Even database admin can't read raw patient data

---

ENCRYPTION IN TRANSIT (Data Moving):

Standard: TLS 1.3 (Transport Layer Security)
├─ Version: 1.3 (latest, most secure)
├─ What it protects: Data moving from clinic to WISeRly servers
├─ Protocol: Hospitals → Internet → WISeRly (all encrypted)
├─ Certificate: Valid SSL certificate from trusted CA
└─ Verification: Browser shows 🔒 padlock icon

Example flow:
1. Doctor uploads patient document at clinic.pdf
2. TLS 1.3 encryption wraps: clinic.pdf → [Encrypted]
3. Transmission: [Encrypted] travels over internet
4. WISeRly receives: [Encrypted] → Automatically decrypts on arrival
5. Result: Only WISeRly sees actual patient data

---

BUSINESS ASSOCIATE AGREEMENT (BAA):

Legal document required when healthcare organization shares PHI with third party.

WISeRly BAA includes:
├─ Warranty: WISeRly meets HIPAA requirements
├─ Access limitations: Only authorized staff access PHI
├─ Breach notification: WISeRly alerts you within 24 hours if breach suspected
├─ Subprocessors: Lists any third parties handling your data
├─ Termination: What happens to data if you cancel
└─ Audit rights: You can audit WISeRly's security

BAA signed automatically during trial signup (no separate process needed).

---

VULNERABILITY SCANNING:

Automated checks:
├─ Daily: Automated scans for known vulnerabilities
├─ Weekly: Penetration testing by security firm
├─ Monthly: Full security audit
├─ Continuous: Real-time intrusion detection
└─ Immediate: Security patches applied <24 hours

Example: A new vulnerability discovered in third-party library
├─ Detected by automated scanning
├─ WISeRly patches affected library
├─ Update deployed to all servers <24 hours
└─ No data breach because vulnerability closed immediately
